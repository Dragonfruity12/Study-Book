Study Book, app made by students for students

Study Book is an app made by students for students, it's like a virtual Textbook, could be used by teachers too! It's open-source and super easy to use, lightweight, fast, and it helps the environment by saving the trees, but how? We will give you a simple "monkey" explanation, Textbooks and paper are all made out of trees, and trees produce oxygen, and humans and animals need oxygen to survive, and so we tried to help the planet by making Study Book, made by students for students! #SaveThePlanet
